### Bonjour/ Hi üëã

My name is Olivier. I have always found data exciting and seen it as an opportunity to uncover truths and become more aware of human biases. 
I am currently studying NLP, SQL, R and Python on Codecademy. I have already completed a Data science path (focusing on SQL and Python) on Codecamedy.
Take a look at some projects I have completed below:
