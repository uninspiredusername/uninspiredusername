### Bonjour/ Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Olivier. I love uncovering truths through data analysis. For exemple, 
I am currently studying SQL and R on CodeAcademy. I have completed the Data science path and Python. Take a look at some Python projects I completed below.

#### Python projects :

Biodiversity in National Parks : Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered ?
Netflix : a financial analysis on stock profile
Orion Constellation plotted in 2D and 3D
Automated Game Night selector : optimizing availability and automating confirmation email
